            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language.    
            <br> 
            It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. 
            <br> 
            It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

            <br> 
            JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.

    <h2>
        Q :- 17 What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
    </h2>

    <p id="p">
        (The use of innerHTML very slow): The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.
        <br>
        (Content is replaced everywhere): Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.
        <br>
        Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.
